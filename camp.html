<p>You camp out in the creepy forest for the night. Good thing you always have a tent on you! Wow, how weird is it that you always have a tent on you? Well, at least you're comfortable for the night and can try to get some sleep. You wake up in the morning refreshed and thankful there aren't a circle of knights surrounding you with their swords, and wonder where to go now.</p>
