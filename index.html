<div class="header">A Thief Walks into a Tavern...</div>
<p>Welcome to the Dark Ages! You wake up in a tavern smelling of old feet, stale ale, and a distinct lack of toilets. Fortunately for you, nobles also don’t get to enjoy the wonders of indoor plumbing, so you don’t bother with the struggles of etiquette and become a thief! Your wit serves you well as you quickly discover that the more nobles you steal from, the more notoriety you gain as a thief. Your task is to become the best thief in the land and evade the king's knights. There is more to this than just stealing from whoever you want: you must take on new identities, evade arrest, and not die. Your crooked dream depends on your choices and interactions with others. So be clever, be careful, be quick on your feet, and you might just survive.
